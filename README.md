Simon Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game, where players test their memory by replicating increasingly complex sequences of colors. The game utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for handling events and animations. When the game begins, players are prompted to press a key to start, and the game generates a random sequence of colors using the four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow). Players must then click the buttons in the correct order to match the sequence. As each round is successfully completed, a new color is added to the sequence, increasing the difficulty.

The game is styled using CSS, with a retro theme enhanced by the 'Press Start 2P' font. The buttons flash to indicate the sequence and change appearance when pressed. The game keeps track of the level and displays it at the top of the screen. If a player clicks the wrong button, a sound plays, the screen briefly flashes red to indicate a "game over," and the player is prompted to restart by pressing any key. The JavaScript logic manages the game flow, including generating sequences, checking player input, and handling game state transitions.

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game scripts are located in game.js, while styles are defined in styles.css. Audio feedback is provided by sound files stored in the sounds directory. This project offers a fun and interactive way to practice web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is a great example of implementing classic game logic in a web environment.
